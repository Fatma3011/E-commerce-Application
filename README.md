# Phone Store E-commerce Web Application
Welcome to the Phone Store E-commerce Web Application â€“ a specialized platform designed for a seamless and engaging shopping experience in the mobile phone market. Built with React, this application utilizes modern web development approaches such as SPA (Single Page Application), HOC (Higher-Order Components), and ES6 features to deliver a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## Features

***Home Page*** : The gateway to our phone store, featuring top deals and popular products.

***Product List Page*** : Easily navigate through our categorized phone listings to find your preferred model or brand.

***Search Page*** : Powerful search functionality to help users quickly find specific phone models or brands.

***Product Detail Page*** : Detailed descriptions, images, and specifications for each phone, providing all the information needed to make an informed decision.

***Cart Page*** : A user-friendly cart to review selections and modify orders before checkout.

***Checkout Page*** : A streamlined and secure checkout process for a hassle-free purchase experience.


## Technology Stack

***Front-End*** : React.js with ES6 for a cleaner, more efficient codebase.

***State Management*** : Utilizing React Context or Redux as per project needs.

***Routing*** : React Router for seamless SPA browsing.

***Styling*** : Styled with CSS.

***Back-End Integration*** : The backend is used for data handling but not developed as part of this project.


## Design Patterns

***SPA (Single Page Application)*** : For an uninterrupted and fluid user experience.

***HOC (Higher-Order Components)*** : Employed for enhancing component logic reusability.

## Installation

To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone [Repository URL]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to your project directory and install the required dependencies.
   ```
   cd [Project Directory]
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up the Mock Server Backend (`json-server`):**
   If you don't have `json-server` installed, install it globally:
   ```
   npm install -g json-server
   ```
   Then, start the mock server. Replace `db.json` with the path to your JSON file if it's different:
   ```
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```

4. **Start the React Application:**
   In a new terminal window, navigate back to your project directory and start the React app:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running and connected to the mock backend server.
